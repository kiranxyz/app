# QA-Challenge

Even in the world of startups and company builders expenses for trips etc. have to be filed and managed.
The fictitious expense software Cashcog tries to manage this. The following challenge depicts a first version of this software and outlines only the user creation process.

For this purpose the Cashcog system provides a `GraphQL-API` and a `web interface`.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

In order to run the provided application, please make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.

`Build` the backend application:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.app.yml build
```

`Run` the backend application:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.app.yml up
